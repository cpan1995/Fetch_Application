# Comments
Bulk of the logic is in the controller partner.js. I wrote some comments in the code to explain my thought process.
I used nodejs to make a simple api server for this assignment. It seems the most reasonable since making a nodejs
server is relatively quick to setup compared to ruby. I used postman to check if the endpoints were working properly.
Im not sure if these endpoints works when fetching from the frotend since i didn't test it that way. 

# Final Thoughts

I think there's a better way of doing this without using as much memory as i did. I had 2 dictionaries 1 array and a variable.
Overall I'm satisfied with the block of code i wrote. But would love to hear some input from a developer with experience. 

This was a really fun assignment thanks for reaching out Lindsey!
